# Twitter-Bot
This Twitter Bot is run using the tweepy module in Python. It can be found <a href="https://www.tweepy.org/">here</a>.

## Installation
### Requirements
- API Key, API Key Secret, Bearer Token, Access Token, Access Token Secret (These can all be found on the developer page. More on this later)
- Installation of various modules
- Optional: image/s

### Getting Started
To get started, simply go to https://developer.twitter.com. 

Make an account and a project for your bot.

Next, apply for elevated access. You should get it immediately as long as you take the questions seriously.

### _Important Note_:
If you grabbed your tokens before receiving elevated access, go back and refresh the tokens.

The ones you receive will be your new ones.

### Installation of Modules
After the project has been forked/whatnot, ensure that all needed modules have been installed. 

For any missing modules, use pip in your terminal via:

``` 
pip install tweepy 
```

for the respective modules. 

To run:
```
python main.py
```

### After that, you should be good to go! 
Be sure that the gimmick of the account and the time in time.sleep is fit to your liking as well.

# Important
### To keep the bot running continuously without keeping a machine on forever, you need access to a cloud service or a machine that will run forever like a Raspberry Pi or a Virtual Machine.
