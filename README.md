# Twitter-Bot
This Twitter Bot is run using the tweepy module in Python. It can be found <a href="https://www.tweepy.org/">here</a>.

## Installation
### Requirements
- API Key, API Key Secret, Bearer Token, Access Token, Access Token Secret (These can all be found on the developer page. More on this later)
- Installation of various modules
- Optional: image/s

### Getting Started
To get started, simply go to https://developer.twitter.com. 

Make an account and a project for your bot.

Next, apply for elevated access. You should get it immediately as long as you take the questions seriously.

### _Important Note_:
If you grabbed your tokens before receiving elevated access, go back and refresh the tokens.

The ones you receive will be your new ones.

### Installation of Modules
After the project has been forked/whatnot, ensure that all needed modules have been installed. 

For any missing modules, use pip in your terminal via:

``` 
pip install tweepy 
```

for the respective modules.

### After that, you should be good to go! 
Be sure that the gimmick of the account and the time in time.sleep is fit to your liking as well.

# IMPORTANT
To keep the bot running continuously without keeping a machine on forever, your cheapest alternatives would likely be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a>, or some sort of Virtual Machine, which can be found on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is also a good alternative, depending on your preference.
